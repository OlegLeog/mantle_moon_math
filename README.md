# Mantle Moon Math Monitor 🌙⚡️

This script doesn't track prices.  
It tracks **delusion**.

Every time someone on Mantle launches a pool with **>1000% APR** and **>100k TVL**,  
the terminal screams:

**"Someone just turned on the money printer."**

You are now witnessing:
- Farmers aping 7-figure sums into 69,420% yields
- Protocols that "accidentally" print infinite tokens
- The exact moment before the chart goes parabolic... or straight to zero

```bash
python mantle_moon_math.py
